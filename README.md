# Universal Path Decomposition of Multilayer Transfer and Scattering Matrices

This repository contains a companion Jupyter notebook for the paper:

**"Universal Path Decomposition of Multilayer Transfer and Scattering Matrices"**  
by Joaquin Garcia-Suarez (2025)

## Overview

Main notebook implements both the **Transfer Matrix Method (TMM)** and a novel **path decomposition approach** to analyze light propagation through multilayer optical systems.
Extra notebook implements both to compare results for a random multilayer optical systems.
Extra Mathematica notebook compares the path-sum decomposition and previously-published analytical results (JMPS, 2022).

## Features

- TE-polarized light propagation through lossless dielectric layers
- Quarter-wave stack configuration centered at 600 nm
- Comparison of TMM and path-based results
- Trace and dispersion plots
- Visualization of amplitude spectra and phase delays

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
